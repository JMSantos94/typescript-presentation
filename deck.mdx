and had to open the `console` in your Chrome Dev tools. I have the tool for you!

## Basic Types
* Boolean
* Number
* String
* Array
* Object
* Null
* Undefined
---
### ... there is more!
* Tuple
* Enum
* Any
* Void
* Never
---
## Boolean
Can be either `true` or `false`

```js
const isHuman: boolean = true;
```
---
## Number
All numbers are floating-point values. There is not distinction between integers
and floats.

```js
const age: number = 20;
const bankAccount: number = 10_000_000; // Comma separations!
const potatos: number = 12_3_45.14_5; // This is also valid
```
---
## String
As its name implies, it stores strings.

```js
const fullName: string = 'Jose Santos';
```
---
## Array
Similar to arrays in JavaScript. Can be written in two ways:

```js
const animals: string[] = ['cows', 'chickens', 'horses'];

// OR

const animals: Array<string> = ['cows', 'chickens', 'horses'];
```
---
## Tuple
This may sound familiar if you have worked with Functional code. If you haven't
don't fret. It is useful when you have a fixed-length array, and you know each
element's type:

```js
const userTuple: [string, number] = ['Jose Santos', 10_000_000];
```
