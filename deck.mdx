# TypeScript: Introduction 🤯
A JavaScript superset with types™
---
# What is TypeScript? 🤔
---
## JavaScript + ES-Next + Additional Features = TypeScript
---
# Why TypeScript? 🤷
---
- **Compilation vs. Transpilation**
- **Strong Static Typing**
- **Support type definitions**
- **Strict null checks**
- **Enhanced IDE support**
- **ES-next compliance**
```notes
If you have ever wondered if your function was receiving the espected values,
and had to open the `console` in your Chrome Dev tools. I have the tool for you!
```

## Basic Types
* Boolean
* Number
* String
* Array
* Object
* Null
* Undefined
---
### ... there is more!
* Tuple
* Enum
* Any
* Void
* Never
---
## Boolean
Can be either `true` or `false`

```js
const isHuman: boolean = true;
```
---
## Number
All numbers are floating-point values. There is not distinction between integers
and floats.

```js
const age: number = 20;
const bankAccount: number = 10_000_000; // Comma separations!
const potatos: number = 12_3_45.14_5; // This is also valid
```
---
## String
As its name implies, it stores strings.

```js
const fullName: string = 'Jose Santos';
```
---
## Array
Similar to arrays in JavaScript. Can be written in two ways:

```js
const animals: string[] = ['cows', 'chickens', 'horses'];

// OR

const animals: Array<string> = ['cows', 'chickens', 'horses'];
```
---
## Tuple
This may sound familiar if you have worked with Functional code. If you haven't
don't fret. It is useful when you have a fixed-length array, and you know each
element's type:

```js
const userTuple: [string, number] = ['Jose Santos', 10_000_000];
```

---
## Enum
Gives friendly names to numeric values

```js
enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
const c: Color = Color.Green;
```
Behind the scenes `Read = 0`, and so forth.
However you can change that!

```js
enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue = 5}
```
You can also access the enumerator's corresponding name, if we have its value:

```js
enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}
const colorName: string = Color[2];
```
---
## Any
As you have guessed, variables of `any` type can store ... any type!

```js
const notSure: any = 4;
notSure = "maybe a string instead";
notSure = false; 
```
**Note**: avoid if possible!
---
## Void
Opposite of `any`. Useful with functions that return nothing.

```js
function logErrors(): void {
    console.log("This is fine! ☕🔥");
}
```

Don't use it for variables.
```js
const life: void = undefined; // or null
```
---
## Null and Undefined
All types can also be of type `null` or `undefined`. 

However, I recommend using
the flag `--strictNullChecks` which will force you to explicitly allow them.

```js
const dummyVariable: string | undefined | null;
```
---
## Never
/\* Skipped for the sake of time \*/
---
## Object
Anything that is not `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or
`undefined`.
```js
function getKeys(obj: object){ /* ... */ }
```
**Note**: We prefer to use **interfaces** rather than using `object`.
---
# Reusable Types ✨
---
We can write our own custom types using `interfaces`. 

```js
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

function fullName(p: Person): string {
    return p.firstName + p.lastName;
}
```
---
Optional fields (`?`)

```js
interface SquareConfig {
    color?: string;
    width?: number;
}
```
---
Read-only

```js
interface Point {
    readonly x: number;
    readonly y: number;
}

const p: Point = { x: 1, y: 2 };
p.x = 5; // Error!

```
---
You can also define properties of other `Objects` such as functions.

```js
interface SearchFunc {
    (source: string, subString: string): boolean;
}

let mySearch: SearchFunc;
mySearch = function(source: string, subString: string): boolean {
    let result = source.search(subString);
    return result > -1;
}
```
